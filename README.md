# trigedaslator
An iOS app linked to the tv serie 'The 100'. 

In the TV serie the protagonists speak a new language, called Trigedaslang, born from an evolution of English. 
Trigedaslator wanted to be a useful tool for all the serie's lovers to directly translate from English to Trigedaslang and backwards.

The app was online on the App Store from April 2017 to June 2020 and was downloaded a total of 8K times on iOS devices. Was self published by myself on my personal Apple Developer account. 

The whole code was designed to work offline and online, downloading eventual updates of the dictionary when the device was back online. 
Backend was structured on the Parse Server platform (by Facebook), now dismissed.

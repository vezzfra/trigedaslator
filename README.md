# trigedaslator
An iOS app linked to the tv serie 'The 100'. 

In the TV serie the protagonists speak a new language, born from an evolution of the English one. 
Trigedaslator wanted to be a useful tool for all the Serie's lovers to directly translate from English to the serie language and backwards.
